# Apache Tapestry: Hotel Booking Simulation

This is the source code to the "Hotel Booking" Tapestry demo app, currently
running with Tapestry 5.4 at:

	https://tapestry-app.apache.org/hotels/

This is Tapestry's take on a classic "Hotel Booking" application (ala Seam). It
demonstrates simple page navigation, form validation and submission, session
management (including a shopping-cart-like mechanism), and easy annotation-based
authentication/authorization.

Building and running the app is easy. It uses maven and jetty, so you just need
to do:

    mvn jetty:run

or you can do `mvn package` and deploy the resulting war file to the servlet
container of your choice, such as Tomcat 7.

The following are two built-in accounts (usernames / passwords) that you can
use to log into the app, or you can create another account by registering with
the link on the login page.

* gosling/gosling
* fowler/fowler
