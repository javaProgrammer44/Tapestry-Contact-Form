This is Tapestry's take on a classic "Contact Form" applicati. It
demonstrates simple page navigation, form validation and submission and easy annotation-based.

Building and running the app is easy. It uses maven and jetty, so you just need
to do:

    mvn jetty:run

or you can do `mvn package` and deploy the resulting war file to the servlet
container of your choice, such as Tomcat 7.
